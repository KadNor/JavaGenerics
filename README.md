# Java Generics
This project is part of the 6th module of the Java Training.

## The excise contains the following tasks:

- write a generic method to exchange the positions of two different elements in an array
- design a class that acts as a library for the following kinds of media: book, video, and newspaper.
Provide one version of the class that uses generics and one that does not.
Feel free to use any additional APIs for storing and retrieving the media.
